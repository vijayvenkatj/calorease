# CalorEase Auth Flow Summary

## Complete Authentication Flow

### 🔄 **User Journey**

1. **New User Visits App**
   - Lands on `/` → Automatically redirected to `/auth/signup`
   - Goes through 5-step integrated signup process
   - Account created with complete profile data
   - Redirected to `/auth/login` with email verification message

2. **Email Verification**
   - User receives email with verification link
   - Clicks link → Goes to `/auth/callback`
   - Callback verifies email and redirects to `/dashboard`

3. **Returning User**
   - Visits `/auth/login`
   - Signs in with verified credentials
   - Redirected to `/dashboard`

### 📍 **Route Structure**

```
/ → /auth/signup (unauthenticated)
/ → /dashboard (authenticated)

/auth/signup → 5-step onboarding + account creation
/auth/login → simple login form
/auth/callback → email verification handler
/dashboard → main app (requires auth)
```

### 🛡️ **Middleware Protection**

- **Unauthenticated users**: Can only access `/auth/*` routes
- **Authenticated users**: Can access all routes
- **Root path**: Smart redirect based on auth status
- **Protected routes**: Automatic redirect to signup for new users

### ✅ **What's Working**

1. **Integrated Signup**: Complete onboarding within signup flow
2. **Email Verification**: Proper email confirmation with callback
3. **Smart Redirects**: Context-aware navigation
4. **No Orphaned Routes**: No separate onboarding pages
5. **Clean State**: Single source of truth in signup form
6. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript integration

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

- **Signup Flow**: 5 steps with form validation and progress tracking
- **Database**: Atomic user + profile creation via tRPC
- **Email**: Supabase handles email verification with custom redirect
- **Session**: Automatic session management via middleware
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and fallbacks

### 📱 **User Experience**

- **Linear Progress**: Clear step-by-step advancement
- **Data Persistence**: Form data maintained across steps
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and success messages
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices
- **Accessible**: Proper labels and keyboard navigation

This flow ensures users complete their profile during signup and are properly verified before accessing the main application.
